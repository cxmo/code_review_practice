Interesting findings include: 

1) Iterative versus recursive functions: 
   In get_increment, the function can be coded recursively or iteratively. 
   The homework suggested to use the imported reduce function, but coding recursively is an interesting approach. 

2) The second function we compared was nonzero. 
   In nonzero, a lot of members wrote forloops, but the performance could be greatly improved with list 
   comprehensions where they can be used. 

3) The third function we compared was asum. 
   Again, in some cases, there was a forloop within a forloop. Some members greatly reduced the time needed 
   to compute by either writing a nested function and calling it within the function and returning the necessary 
   output.
